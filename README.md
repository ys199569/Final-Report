# Final Report

**Final Report** (*35%*): The final project report is the distillation of your group's efforts over the course of the quarter. **Only one report** should be submitted by your group, with each person's name on the report. It should be around 12-15 pages double spaced, excluding references (but you can have an Appendix of any length you like). Note that _all code should be placed in the Appendix, different than the problem sets_. Code must be submitted for reproducibility. The final report should contain some combination (if not all) of the following sections:
	
* Title Page and Contribution Statement (listing all group members and their roles in the project; note that by typing your name on the project, you agree that you contributed *equally* to the project)
* Introduction, motivation, and (light) literature review
* Empirical Strategy (methods, data, preprocessing, etc.)
* Analysis & Results
* Discussion
* Conclusion
